The game is initialized with a configuration json file. This allows for the community to create their own version of gameplay. There is no coding involved as everything will come from the json file itself. The configuration file will contain almost all values found within the game.

### You should know
* A Github account is *required* to submit your config file at [Configurations](https://github.com/TinkerersSubject/Configurations)
